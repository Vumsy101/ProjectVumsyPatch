[b][u]Project Vumsy Patch Ver. 3.0.3[/u][/b]
____________________________________
[b][u]Brief overview:[/u][/b]

This is a PvP patch meant for modded online play that adjusts underperforming parts, weapons, systems and mechanics to be more competitively viable. The goal was to not make anything weaker and not fully revert official nerfs, and if anything got weaker it has gotten well compensated.

[list]
[*]Nothing has been nerfed, one number might've gone slightly down to bring other numbers drastically up.
[*]Everything that were not strong in terms of parts, weapons, mechanics, etc, has been buffed.
[*]Everything that was already good has been left alone as much as possible.
[*]Melee specialization deals less damage, but increases melee uptime significantly.
[*]Shields no longer hard counter melee and status, multiple shields has been buffed.
[*]Projectiles speeds up over a set distance and almost always deal at least 1 damage within active range.
[*]Light weights are tankier, Heavy weights are faster.
[*]Various quality of life changes.

[b][u]Installation guide:[/u][/b]

Either copy and paste the contents inside this folder into your Open Server/Mod Engine 2 "mod" folder or rename the folder into "mod" or whatever folder you've adjusted Open Server/Mod Engine 2 to read mods from.

Launch by using launchmod_armoredcore6.bat to play modded and through steam to play vanilla. The game will launch without anti cheat, and save files and mods will be separate from your vanilla files.

If you want to use your vanilla save file, locate and copy your AC60000.sl2 save file, and rename the copy's extension to AC60000.pvp and leave it in your save folder. (WARNING: Do not revert a .pvp file back to .sl2, you will risk a ban.)

To uninstall, remove all contents except altsaves.toml, either through deleting the old contents of the "mod" folder or renaming the folder.

If you are updating from a previous version, simply delete the old "mod" folder content and replace it with the content in this one.
